# SCTLD-ballast-transmission

Scripts and data associated with disease transmission experiments conducted at UM-CIMAS/NOAA-AOML (https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/experimental-reef-lab/) to determine whether ship's ballast water can serve as an stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) vector, and evaluate whether ballast water treatment (UVC radiation) is effective at reducing transmission. This repository is divided up into directories for transmission metrics and tissue histology.
